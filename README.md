# AdventureWorks Sample Database Project

This project uses the AdventureWorks sample database to showcase various SQL queries, data analysis, and reports. The AdventureWorks sample database is a fictional company database that represents a bicycle manufacturer's operations. The data contained in the database is from 2005 to January 2021. This project focuses on the existing customers and the similarities amongst them to see where the most money is being made and from what demographic of people and how to get more profit moving forward.
